              Hello, I'm Binod, a hopeful student from rural Bihar. Recently, I
              received a life-changing scholarship to study medicine in
              Singapore ‚Äî a huge step toward fulfilling my dream of becoming a
              doctor and giving back to my community. While tuition is covered,
              I urgently need ‚Çπ50,000 to manage my flight and initial stay for a
              month. My family has done all they can, but I now turn to you for
              support. Every small contribution brings me closer to my goal and
              makes a big difference. Thank you for your kindness and for
              standing by a dream that could change many lives
            </p>
